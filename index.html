            Niko grew up in Yugoslavia, where he fought in the Yugoslav Wars.
            He later worked for organized crime syndicates as a hired-gun in
            Liberty City. Ever since the wars ended, Niko's main goal in life
            was to find and kill one of two men: Florian Cravic or Darko Brevic,
            for one of them betrayed his military unit during the wars and nearly
            killed him. Niko is the younger cousin of Roman Bellic and the son of Milica Bellic.
